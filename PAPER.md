**Abstract:**

This paper presents a methodology for automating the retrieval and presentation of paired photographic assets within Digital Asset Management (DAM) systems, addressing the challenges of manual correlation and contextualisation. By leveraging metadata and API interactions, a workflow is developed to dynamically retrieve and sequence related images, such as front and back views, enhancing archival accessibility and narrative integrity. The implementation, utilising the Kaltura API as a practical example, demonstrates the efficacy of this approach in streamlining archival workflows and enriching user engagement.

## Introduction

<a id="introduction"></a>

Audiovisual preservation and access are central tenets of archival practice. The effective management and presentation of photographic collections, particularly those containing paired images, presents significant challenges. Manual correlation of related images, such as front and back views, is a time-consuming process that can disrupt the contextual narrative inherent within these collections. This paper addresses the need for streamlined methodologies to dynamically retrieve and present paired photographic assets, thereby enhancing archival accessibility and facilitating deeper scholarly and public engagement.

## Theoretical Framework

<a id="theoretical-framework"></a>

The proposed methodology draws upon principles of metadata management, API interactions, and dynamic content presentation. Metadata, when accurately and consistently applied, serves as a crucial link between related assets, enabling automated retrieval and contextualisation. API interactions facilitate seamless communication between client-side interfaces and DAM systems, allowing for efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Dynamic content presentation, through the creation of playlists and media players, ensures that paired assets are presented in a logical and user-friendly manner.

## Methodology

<a id="methodology"></a>

The workflow developed in this study comprises the following stages:

1.  **User Request:** A user initiates a request for a photographic asset using a unique identifier.
2.  **Metadata Retrieval:** The DAM system's API retrieves the associated metadata, identifying key attributes such as "front view" or "back view".
3.  **Related Asset Retrieval:** Based on the metadata, the system automatically retrieves the related photographic asset.
4.  **Dynamic Playlist Generation:** A playlist is created, ensuring the paired images are presented in the correct order.
5.  **Media Player Display:** A media player seamlessly displays the paired assets to the user.
6.  **Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms inform users of any missing assets.

This methodology relies on accurate and consistent metadata application, enabling the system to identify and retrieve related assets effectively.

## Implementation and Results

<a id="implementation-and-results"></a>

A practical implementation of this workflow was developed utilising the Kaltura API. This implementation demonstrates the retrieval of media entries and their corresponding "flip-side" entries, displaying them side-by-side. The client-side interface, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, interacts with the Kaltura API to retrieve metadata and embed media players. The implementation includes error handling for API requests and XML parsing, ensuring a robust user experience.

The provided code, included as supplementary material, illustrates the technical implementation of the workflow. The system accurately retrieves and displays paired images based on metadata, demonstrating the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed methodology.

## Discussion

<a id="discussion"></a>

The automation of paired photographic asset retrieval and presentation offers several significant implications:

* **Enhanced Contextualisation:** Presenting paired images together provides richer context for researchers and the public, facilitating a deeper understanding of the archival material.
* **Resource Optimisation:** Automating the retrieval process saves valuable time and resources, allowing archivists to focus on other critical tasks.
* **Improved Accessibility:** Dynamic playlist generation ensures that paired assets are easily accessible and presented in a user-friendly manner.
* **Metadata Importance:** This process strengthens the importance of accurate and consistent metadata in creating relationships between related assets.
* **Digital Exhibitions:** Streamlines the creation of digital exhibitions that showcase paired photographs, enhancing engagement and understanding.

The practical application of this methodology within a personal archive highlights its scalability and adaptability to diverse archival collections.

## Conclusion

<a id="conclusion"></a>

This study demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of automating paired photographic asset retrieval and presentation within DAM systems. By leveraging metadata and API interactions, archivists can streamline workflows, enhance archival accessibility, and facilitate deeper engagement with photographic collections. This approach bridges the gap between isolated images and their collective narrative, ensuring that the full story is preserved for future generations.

## Future Directions

Future research could explore the integration of machine learning algorithms to automate metadata extraction and asset correlation. Additionally, the development of standardised metadata schemas for paired photographic assets would further enhance interoperability and accessibility across different archival systems.
